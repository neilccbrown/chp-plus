A set of high-level concurrency utilities built on Communicating Haskell Processes
===
This is a set of utilities that depend on the [chp library](https://github.com/twistedsquare/chp/).   I am not actively developing or maintaining the library but is preserved here for anyone that wants to use or tinker with it.

The original repository is lost, so this is an import of the latest version.
